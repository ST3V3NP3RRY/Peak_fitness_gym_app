## Introduction
This was my first project while studying software development at CodeClan. The timeframe for the project was one week (6th Oct -> 13th Oct 2022).

- Python3 with the Flask micro-framework
- Jinga2 templating engine
- SQL (with PostgreSQL object-relational database management system)
- Object-oriented programming
- Test-driven development(TDD)
