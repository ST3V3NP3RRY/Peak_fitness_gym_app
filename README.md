# Peak fitness - gym booking system

## CodeClan - week 5 - Solo Project

## Introduction
This was my first project while studying software development at CodeClan. The timeframe for the project was one week (6th Oct -> 13th Oct 2022). The project marked the end of the first module where I learne the fundamental principles of software development. This included learning the following technologies and design patterns:
- Python3 with the Flask micro-framework
- Jinga2 templating engine
- SQL (with PostgreSQL object-relational database management system)
- Object-oriented programming
- Test-driven development(TDD)
- Representational state transfer architecture (RESTful development)
- Model-View-Controller architecture (MVC)

## Brief

The purpose of the project was to design an activity booking system for a gym. The task was to create software that manages the members, classes and bookings of a gym. The minimum viable product included enabling the user to create and edit members, create and delete classes, view a list of classes, assign a member to a class and view members attending each class.

## Planning

I began by mapping out the fundamental features of the application by producing a series of wireframes allowing me to visualise the components and how the app would be structured. I also mapped out the relationships between the tables in my database using class diagrams.
